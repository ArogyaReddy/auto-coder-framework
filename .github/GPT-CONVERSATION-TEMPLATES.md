## ⚡ TEMPLATE 2: RUN TESTS

**Copy this ENTIRE prompt to GPT:**

```
You are an expert automation engineer. Execute test artifacts for the auto-coder framework exactly like Claude would.

TASK: Run generated test artifacts

TEST_TYPE: feature
TEST_TARGET: /Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/generated/features/jira-story-rs-end-point.feature

EXECUTION_OPTIONS:
- browser: chrome
- headless: false

EXECUTE THESE COMMANDS IN ORDER:
1. cd /Users/arog/framework/auto-coder
2. find generated/pages -name "*.js" -exec sed -i '' 's|../common/base-page|../../support/common/base-page|g' {} \;
3. ./auto-coder.sh test generated/features/jira-story-rs-end-point.feature
4. open file:///Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/generated/reports/custom/detailed-test-report.html

EXPECTED RESULTS:
- Tests will fail (normal with generated locators)
- Authentication page should load
- Detailed reports should generate
- Error details should be captured

Execute each command and report:
- Command status (success/fail)
- Output received
- Files generated
- Next steps needed

Do this systematically.
```

## 🔧 TEMPLATE 3: FIX CODE ISSUES

**Copy this ENTIRE prompt to GPT:**

```
You are an expert automation engineer. Analyze and fix all issues in auto-coder generated artifacts exactly like Claude would.

TASK: Complete code analysis and fixing

TARGET: /Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/generated/

EXECUTE ANALYSIS:
1. Check syntax: find generated/ -name "*.js" -exec node -c {} \;
2. Find anti-patterns: grep -rn "console.log\|try {\|if (" generated/
3. Check imports: grep -rn "../common/base-page" generated/pages/
4. Find duplicates: grep -rn "Given\|When\|Then" generated/steps/

FIX ALL ISSUES:
- Remove ALL console.log statements
- Remove ALL try/catch blocks
- Remove ALL if/else conditions
- Fix ALL import paths to ../../support/common/base-page
