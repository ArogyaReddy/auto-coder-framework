# Auto-Coder Framework - Getting Started Guide

## 🚀 Welcome to Auto-Coder Framework

### What is Auto-Coder Framework?

Auto-Coder Framework is an intelligent test artifact generator that transforms requirements from various sources into professional-grade test automation assets. It learns from existing patterns in the SBS_Automation framework to create dynamic, adaptable test artifacts without hard-coded limitations.

### The Magic Behind the Framework

Instead of using static templates, our framework:

- **Learns** from real-world patterns in SBS_Automation
- **Understands** requirement intent using natural language processing
- **Adapts** to different domains and business contexts
- **Generates** professional-quality test artifacts
- **Maintains** consistency with established standards

## 🎯 Core Concept: Read → Understand → Extract → Generate → Run

### 1. **READ** 📖

Framework accepts requirements from multiple sources:

- **Text Files**: JIRA stories, requirement documents
- **Markdown Files**: Structured documentation
- **Images**: UI mockups, wireframes (OCR processing)
- **URLs**: Web pages with requirements
- **Single/Multi-line Text**: Quick requirement input
- **Confluence Pages**: Collaborative requirement documents
- **Playwright Recordings**: Existing test recordings
- **cURL Commands**: API testing requirements

### 2. **UNDERSTAND** 🧠

Advanced NLP processing to comprehend:

- **User Stories**: As a... I want... So that...
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Given... When... Then...
- **Business Rules**: Constraints and validations
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system should do
- **Entities & Relationships**: Key business objects
- **Workflows & Processes**: User journeys and interactions

### 3. **EXTRACT** 🔍

Intelligent information extraction:

- **User Roles**: Admin, Client, Employee, etc.
- **Actions**: Login, Create, Update, Verify, etc.
- **Entities**: Orders, Employees, Reports, etc.
- **Business Context**: Domain-specific terminology
- **Test Scenarios**: Derivable test cases
- **Validation Points**: What needs to be verified

### 4. **GENERATE** ⚡

Create professional test artifacts:

- **Feature Files** (.feature): Gherkin BDD scenarios
- **Step Definitions** (.js): Cucumber step implementations
- **Page Objects** (.js): Playwright page models
- **Test Scripts** (.js): Complete test automation
- **Summary Documentation** (.md): Human-readable summaries
- **Test Data** (.json): Structured test data

### 5. **RUN** 🏃‍♂️

Ready-to-execute test automation:

- **Cucumber Integration**: Run BDD scenarios
- **Playwright Execution**: Automated browser testing
- **CI/CD Ready**: Integration with build pipelines
- **Reporting**: Test execution results
- **Maintenance**: Easy updates and modifications

## 🎯 What Makes This Framework Special?

### 1. **Pattern Learning**

- Analyzes existing SBS_Automation framework
- Extracts proven patterns and structures
- Builds intelligent vocabulary from real usage
- Continuously learns and improves

### 2. **Dynamic Adaptation**

- No hard-coded business logic
- Adapts to different domains automatically
- Uses configurable templates
- Scales across requirement types

### 3. **Quality Assurance**

- Follows established SBS standards
- Validates output against proven patterns
- Ensures professional-grade artifacts
- Maintains consistency across projects

### 4. **Intelligent Understanding**

- Uses NLP to understand requirement intent
- Extracts entities, actions, and relationships
- Maps requirements to appropriate patterns
- Generates contextually relevant artifacts

## 🚀 Quick Start Example

### Input Requirement:

```
As a payroll administrator, I want to process employee
terminations so that final pay calculations are accurate
and compliance requirements are met.

Acceptance Criteria:
- System should calculate final pay including accrued vacation
- Tax withholdings must be calculated correctly
- Termination date should be recorded
- Final paycheck should be generated
```

### Generated Artifacts:

**Feature File:**

```gherkin
Feature: Employee Termination Processing
  As a payroll administrator
  I want to process employee terminations
  So that final pay calculations are accurate and compliance requirements are met

  Scenario: Process employee termination with final pay calculation
    Given a payroll administrator is logged into the system
    When they process an employee termination
    Then the final pay should include accrued vacation
    And tax withholdings should be calculated correctly
    And the termination date should be recorded
    And a final paycheck should be generated
```

**Step Definitions:**

```javascript
const { Given, When, Then } = require("@cucumber/cucumber");
const PayrollPage = require("../pages/payroll-page");

Given("a payroll administrator is logged into the system", async function () {
  await new PayrollPage(this.page).loginAsPayrollAdmin();
});

When("they process an employee termination", async function () {
  await new PayrollPage(this.page).processEmployeeTermination();
});
// ... additional steps
```
