Here’s how you can get GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o agents to work like Claude for **test artifact generation, test running, code fixing, analysis, debugging, and documentation** in your auto-coder framework:

---

## 1. Use Explicit, Step-by-Step Prompts

GPT agents need clear, detailed instructions. Always provide:

- The exact file paths
- The expected output format
- The sequence of steps (never “just do it”)

**Example for Test Artifact Generation:**

```
SYSTEM: You are an expert automation engineer. Generate test artifacts for the auto-coder framework. Follow these steps exactly.

USER REQUEST:
1. Read requirements from: input/jira/jira-story-cfc-bundle.txt
2. Generate feature file in: generated/features/jira-story-cfc-bundle.feature
3. Generate steps file in: generated/steps/jira-story-cfc-bundle-steps.js
4. Generate page object in: generated/pages/jira-story-cfc-bundle-page.js
5. Ensure all files match SBS_Automation patterns.
6. Use real locators, not mocks.
7. Add summary documentation in: generated/summary/jira-story-cfc-bundle_guide.md
8. Report any missing step implementations.
9. Validate all generated files for syntax and structure.
10. Tell me the output paths and any issues.
```

---

## 2. Use the Conversation Templates

You already have a great template in `gpt-conversation-template.md`. For **test generation**, add a section like:

```
"Generate test artifacts for the following input:
- input/jira/jira-story-cfc-bundle.txt

MANDATORY STEPS:
1. Generate feature, steps, and page files in the generated/ folder.
2. Use SBS_Automation patterns.
3. Use real locators.
4. Add summary documentation.
5. Validate all files.
6. Report output paths and issues."
```

---

## 3. Provide Reference Patterns

Include sample files from SBS_Automation as references. For best results:

- Attach or link to SBS_Automation feature, steps, and page files.
- Tell GPT: “Match this pattern exactly.”

---

## 4. Use Pre-Flight Checklists

Before any generation or code fix, instruct GPT to:

- Check for existing files
- Validate directory structure
- Confirm all dependencies

---

## 5. Use the Troubleshooting Guide

If GPT gets stuck, refer it to `gpt-troubleshooting.md` for step-by-step recovery.

---

## 6. Use NPM Scripts for Automation

Add scripts to package.json for common tasks:

- `npm run gpt-generate` (for artifact generation)
- `npm run gpt-execute` (for running tests)
- `npm run gpt-fix` (for code fixing)

---

## 7. Documentation and Analysis

For documentation, use prompts like:

```
"Read all generated files for jira-story-cfc-bundle. Summarize the test flow, key locators, and any missing implementations. Save the summary in generated/summary/jira-story-cfc-bundle_guide.md."
```

For code analysis/debugging:

```
"Analyze generated/steps/jira-story-cfc-bundle-steps.js for missing step implementations, syntax errors, and SBS_Automation pattern mismatches. Report all findings."
```

---

## 8. Settings and Model Instructions

If you can set system instructions for GPT agents, use:

- “Always follow explicit step-by-step instructions.”
- “Never skip validation or reporting.”
- “Always match SBS_Automation patterns for all generated code.”

---

## 9. Attach Reference Files

Whenever possible, attach or link to:

- Example requirements
- SBS_Automation reference files
- Previous successful outputs

---

## 10. Use the “Reset” Command

If GPT gets confused, use:

```
"Stop. Start over. Follow the checklist in gpt-troubleshooting.md."
```

## Summary Table

| Task            | Prompt/Script/Setting Example                                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Test Generation | See above explicit prompt, use `npm run gpt-generate`                                       |
| Test Running    | Use template in gpt-conversation-template.md, or `npm run gpt-execute`                      |
| Code Fixing     | "Find and fix all syntax errors in generated/steps/\*.js. Report changes."                  |
| Code Analysis   | "Analyze generated/pages/\*.js for SBS_Automation pattern compliance. List all mismatches." |
| Debugging       | "Run tests, report all failures, and suggest fixes for ambiguous or undefined steps."       |
| Documentation   | "Summarize all generated artifacts and test flows in generated/summary/[name]\_guide.md."   |

## Final Advice

- **Always use explicit, step-by-step prompts.**
- **Reference SBS_Automation patterns and files.**
- **Use the provided templates and troubleshooting guides.**
- **Automate common tasks with NPM scripts.**
- **Validate and report every step.**

If you follow these practices, GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o will work as reliably and thoroughly as Claude for all aspects of your framework!
