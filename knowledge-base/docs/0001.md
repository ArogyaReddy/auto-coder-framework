/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/generated/features/client-navigation-users-2025-07-18T13-05-34-717Z-feature.feature

/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/generated/pages/employee-general-item-2025-07-18T02-46-02-276Z-page.js

what are the requirements for these features?
Are these really generated for the given requirements?
I dont think so.

Here are the requirment files that I used.

File: input/text/jira-story-cfc-landing-page.txt
File: input/text/jira-story-cfc-core-run-menu.txt

And the generated feature files are NO way related to these input?

Can you please explain,how are we generating the test artifacts?
Are we reallty following as per the PROJECT Guideliens and approach?

I am confused with the auto-coder-framework functionality and behaviour?

What are we doing?
How are we doing?
Are we using the SBS_Automation [existing framework] patterns, features, steps, pages and tests as a mimic / patterns in auto-coder-framework?

Can you please update me if you have understood :
auto-coder-framework - GOAL
auto-coder-framework- APPROACH
auto-coder-framework - TEST ARTIFACTS GENERATION PROCESS

==========================
🎯 AUTO-CODER FRAMEWORK - GOAL

PRIMARY MISSION: Build an intelligent test artifact generator that LEARNS from
SBS_Automation patterns to create dynamic, adaptable test automation assets
from any requirement source.

KEY PRINCIPLE: Extract patterns dynamically from SBS_Automation knowledge base

🛠️ AUTO-CODER FRAMEWORK - APPROACH

CORRECT APPROACH (Agent Prompts):

1. EXTRACT patterns from SBS_Automation (/qa_automation/SBS_Automation/)
2. BUILD knowledge base from real SBS features, steps, pages
3. ANALYZE requirements for domain-specific terms
4. MATCH requirements to learned SBS patterns
5. GENERATE artifacts using SBS templates + requirement context

⚙️ AUTO-CODER FRAMEWORK - TEST ARTIFACTS GENERATION PROCESS

Input → Domain Classification → SBS Pattern Matching → Template Selection → Population → Validation → Output

=========================================================

Here are my thoughts and approach to the auto-coder-framework:
Let me know if that's what you are looking for in the auto-coder-framework and its functionality.
Let me know if that's what we implemented in the auto-coder-framework.

# my thoughts and approach to the auto-coder-framework:

I have existing SBS_Automation framework which has 1,915 features, 563 steps, 585 pages and 295 roles and so on.
SBS_Automation framework is used across multiple teams and I have to follow the same patterns, features, steps, pages and tests and implement them in the auto-coder-framework.
And while implementing the auto-coder-framework, I have to follow and use the same patterns, features, steps, pages and tests from the SBS_Automation framework.
But, I am trying to solve a problem here and reduce efforts and time for all teams and increase the productivity and efficiency of generating test artifacts from any requirement source.
So, auto-coder is designed to leverage the existing SBS_Automation framework assets while introducing intelligent automation capabilities to streamline the test artifact generation process.
Since the SBS_Automation framework is already established and widely used, the auto-coder aims to enhance its functionality by automating the generation of test artifacts based on requirements, while still adhering to the existing patterns and structures.
So, the auto-coder is designed to work in conjunction with the SBS_Automation framework, utilizing its patterns and assets to create a more efficient and intelligent test artifact generation process.
Let's say, the auto-coder is like an intelligent assistant that learns from the SBS_Automation framework and uses that knowledge [or uses every piece of information from the SBS_Automation framework] to generate test artifacts dynamically based on requirements.

# In SBS_Automation framework : What we do is:

1. When feature or requirements are ready with the UI / functionality [from any project, any team]
2. We use the existing SBS_Automation framework and create the feature files, step definitions, page objects and tests.
3. And then run the tests to validate the functionality in different environments.
4. That's the existing process we follow in the SBS_Automation framework.

## Now, in the auto-coder : What we do is:

1. We are trying to automate the above process and make it more efficient and intelligent.
2. Let's say, before the UI is ready, before the functionality is implemented
3. Since we have JIRA stories, Confluence pages, requirements , features, etc.
4. We want launch the auto-coder and provide the requirements, features, etc.
5. The requirements can be in any format, like text, text file, markdown, images, URLs, Confluence pages, API cURL etc.
6. And then auto-coder will analyze the requirements, features, tests, test scenarios, use cases etc.
7. And then it will extract the patterns, features, steps, pages and tests from the SBS_Automation framework
8. And then it will generate the test artifacts dynamically [summary, feature file, step definitions, page objects, tests] based on the requirements, features, etc.
9. And then it will validate the generated test artifacts against the SBS_Automation framework patterns, features, steps, pages and tests
10. And then it will save the generated test artifacts in the generated [or output] directory
11. And then it will provide the generated test artifacts to the user
12. And then user can run the tests to validate the functionality in different environments
13. And then user can use the generated test artifacts to validate the functionality in different environments

## Challenges :

1. The auto-coder needs to be able to understand the requirements, features, tests, test scenarios, use cases etc. in different formats
2. The auto-coder needs to accurately extract relevant information from the SBS_Automation framework to generate test artifacts
3. The auto-coder must ensure that the generated test artifacts adhere to the existing patterns and structures of the SBS_Automation framework
4. The auto-coder should be able to handle ambiguous or incomplete requirements and still generate useful test artifacts
5. The auto-coder needs to provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with and utilize the generated test artifacts

## Questions:

1. Are we really extracting patterns dynamically from the SBS_Automation framework?
2. Are we using the existing SBS_Automation framework assets to generate test artifacts?
3. Are we following the same patterns, features, steps, pages and tests from the SBS_Automation framework?
4. Are we generating test artifacts dynamically based on requirements, features, tests, test scenarios, use cases etc.?
5. Are we validating the generated test artifacts against the SBS_Automation framework patterns, features, steps, pages and tests?
6. Are we providing the generated test artifacts to the user in a user-friendly manner?
7. Are we ensuring that the generated test artifacts adhere to the existing patterns and structures of the SBS_Automation framework?
8. Are we able to handle ambiguous or incomplete requirements and still generate useful test artifacts?
9. Are we providing a user-friendly interface for users to interact with and utilize the generated test artifacts?
10. Are we able to run the tests to validate the functionality in different environments using the generated test artifacts?
11. Are we able to use the generated test artifacts to validate the functionality in different environments?
12. Are we able to increase the productivity and efficiency of generating test artifacts from any requirement source?
13. Are we able to maintain the quality and reliability of the generated test artifacts over time?

## If needed :

So, couple of things we can do is:

1. We can improve the requirement analysis process to better understand the requirements, features, tests, test scenarios, use cases etc.
   1. Since we do not know how the user will provide the requirements, features and how good the requirements are
      1. Sometimes the requirements may be vague or incomplete, making it difficult to extract relevant information.
      2. And sometimes the requirements may be in different formats, making it difficult to analyze and extract relevant information.
      3. And sometimes the requirements may be too complex or too simple, making it difficult to generate useful test artifacts.
      4. And sometimes the requirements may be too specific or too generic, making it difficult to generate useful test artifacts.
      5. And sometimes the requirements may not be well-defined, making it difficult to generate useful test artifacts.
      6. And sometimes the requirements may not be aligned with the existing SBS_Automation framework patterns, features, steps, pages and tests, making it difficult to generate useful test artifacts.
   2. So, we can develop a more structured approach to requirement gathering and analysis.
      1. We can use a combination of manual and automated techniques to gather requirements from different sources.
      2. we can use ready made requirements templates or forms to capture requirements in a structured manner.
   3. So, we can implement a more robust requirement analysis process that can handle different formats and structures of requirements.
   4. We can use NLP techniques to better understand the context and intent of the requirements
   5. We can implement a more robust requirement analysis process that can handle different formats and structures of requirements.
   6. We can use NLP techniques to better understand the context and intent of the requirements.
   7. We can implement a more flexible and adaptive requirement analysis process that can handle different types of requirements and features.
   8. We can also implement a more intelligent requirement analysis process that can learn from the existing SBS_Automation framework patterns and features.
2. We can enhance the extraction process to accurately capture relevant information from the SBS_Automation framework.
3. We can implement validation checks to ensure the generated test artifacts adhere to the existing patterns and structures of the SBS_Automation framework.
4. We can develop strategies to handle ambiguous or incomplete requirements effectively.
5. We can create a user-friendly interface for users to interact with and utilize the generated test artifacts.
6. We can establish a robust testing process to validate the functionality in different environments using the generated test artifacts.
7. We can focus on improving the productivity and efficiency of generating test artifacts from any requirement source.
8. We can implement measures to maintain the quality and reliability of the generated test artifacts over time.

Where is this title coming from?

Please use the same name as the requirements file for the generated feature files [feature file name should be same as the requirements file name, step definitions, page objects and tests should also follow the same naming convention]

# 3.

/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/generated/tests
What is this directory?
the tests seemed to be in a different format or structure [compared to real tests in SBS_Automation framework]
What do we do with these tests?
How can we run these tests?

# 4.

If I ask you to generate test artifacts for the requirements file:
Requirements file:
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/input/text/jira-story-workers-comp.txt

when you generate the test artifacts, please compare with the auto-coder-framework generated feature file:
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/generated/features/payroll-creation-page-2025-07-18T13-58-13-355Z-feature.feature

And you would how BAD we did in generating the test artifacts in the auto-coder-framework.

And please explain what's the difference between the auto-coder-framework generated feature file and YOUR generated feature file for SAME the requirements file:

AND why is the auto-coder-framework not generating the test artifacts as YOU.

# 5.

The auto-coder-framework is not generating the test artifacts as per the PROJECT Guidelines and approach.
It's really important that we fix the auto-coder-framework to generate the test artifacts the BEST way possible.

TEST_TYPE: feature
TEST_TARGET: /Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/generated/features/cfc-api-test.feature

EXECUTION_OPTIONS:

- browser: chrome
- headless: false

=============

We should be able to run the generated tests using our interactive CLI as well, correct?
Can we please add the tests execution / running tests functionality into our interactive CLI please.

Also, please dobule check the interactive CLI..
It's behaving weired sometime..
when clicked exit, it loads 20 times the same menu..

And see we disaply only needed information during interactive mode

Also, we just added features , steps, pages from requirements [a text, an image..]
And no locators/UI elements are captured and added to the steps and pages..
How the tests are failing...I wonder why and how?

I am hiping tests would fail becase there are no real locators, correct?

How come the tests are passing??
Are we validating only files and content? not the real application tests?

=============

Can you please explain more about these with examples and with auto-coder-framework code and tests.
Also, please explain what do, where to, how to change/udpate locators with real elmennts and Add proper element selectors (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath)
how to , what to, where to, how to replace the mock implementations with real Playwright/Selenium calls

Why the Tests are Passing Without Real Locators:

The tests are passing because they use mock implementations that simulate the behavior
The page object files contain state management in memory rather than actual UI interactions
All test verifications are checking in-memory state, not actual UI elements
Console logs show the expected behavior but don't interact with real applications
How Test Mocking Works:

When the page object methods are called, they update internal state variables
Test assertions check these variables rather than real UI elements
For example, in the CFCBundlePage class, verifyCFCBundleAddedWithoutActivation() checks this.componentState.available && !this.componentState.activated which are just JavaScript variables
How to Make Tests Use Real Locators:

Replace the mock implementations with real Playwright/Selenium calls
Add proper element selectors (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath)
Update the verification methods to check actual UI state

=============

Thanks.
So, with the above, with all your updated tests,
if I run the tests, the tests will still fail.
Because, the locators are not real and we know that we created the test aritifacts and the tests from a nornal requirments[text, iamge] not from real UI/application - That's okay. Users know this FACT.
And we need these kind of real tests, real artifacts from auto-coder-framework. Not the MOCK.

Can we please implement these.
And so when we run the tests, all the tests wll fail, because of the invalid locators.
And we all know the FACT, it's okay and it's EXPECTED.

Can we please implement these.
Please udpate with the both the prompts to refelect the same and we implement that.
generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md
run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

please update. And so when I request you know it's to be the real tests and not the MOC.

And please note,
our page objects,
our featture files
our steps files
Should match [SHOULD BE SAME AS SBS_Automation]

So that once we generated test artifacts using auto-coder-framework,
If the real UI is present, then the users will update the locators and run the tests from auto-coder-framework.
Once all done, Users will copy the generated files features, steps, pages, tests [geneated folder] and paste them in SBS_Automation and start working and running them.

please update accordingly.

Can we please implement these.
Please udpate with the both the prompts to refelect the same and we implement that.

### Step file comparison:

## Observations and isues from our auto-coder-framework generated steps file:

1. Before : Before is used in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - Before is not used in existing SBS_Automation framework steps file
   - Before is not needed in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - We can remove Before from our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
2. Try-Catch: Try-Catch is used in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - Try-Catch is not used in existing SBS_Automation framework steps file
   - Try-Catch is not needed in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - We can remove Try-Catch from our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
3. If-Else: If-Else is used in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - If-Else is not used in existing SBS_Automation framework steps file
   - If-Else is not needed in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - We can remove If-Else from our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
4. Console Logs: Console logs are used in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - Console logs are not used in existing SBS_Automation framework steps file
   - Console logs are not needed in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - We can remove Console logs from our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
5. Timeouts: Timeouts are NOT used in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - Timeouts are used in existing SBS_Automation framework steps file
   - Timeouts are needed in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - We can add Timeouts to our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - Example: { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }
6. Page Objects: Page objects are used in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file in before method [ this.classicFooterPage = new ClassicFooterPage(this.page); ]
   - Page objects are used in existing SBS_Automation framework steps file
   - Page objects are needed in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - We can use Page objects in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
   - Example: new HomePage(this.page)., [not in Before method]
7. expect(isNextGen).to.be.true;: expect is used in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file

- expect is not used in existing SBS_Automation framework steps file
- expect is not needed in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
- We can remove expect from our auto-coder-framework generated steps file
- Instead, we can use assertions like assert.isTrue(isNextGen, 'Next Gen is not enabled'); or assert.equal(isNextGen, true, 'Next Gen is not enabled');
- Assertions are used in existing SBS_Automation framework steps file

8. Assertions: Assertions are NOT used in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file - Assertions are used in existing SBS_Automation framework steps file - Assertions are needed in our auto-coder-framework generated steps file - We can add Assertions to our auto-coder-framework generated steps file - Example: assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
   In existing SBS_Automation framework steps file : let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed(); used in step
   Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {
   let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed();
   assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
   });

In our auto-coder-framework generated steps file : this.classicFooterPage = new ClassicFooterPage(this.page); used in Before.
Before(async function() {
this.classicFooterPage = new ClassicFooterPage(this.page);
});

## Points to note here from existing steps file from SBS_Automation framework:

1. The steps in steps file are simple.
   1. Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {
      let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed();
      assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
      });
2. The steps in steps file do not have any try catch block [no try, no catch]
   1. Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {

      assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
      });
3. The steps in steps file do not have any conditions, or loops [no if, no whiles, no fors]
   1. Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {
      let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed();
      assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
      });
4. The steps in steps file do not have any console logs [no console.logs]
   1. Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {
      let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed();
      assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
      });
5. The steps in steps file have a time out [timeout is set like { timeout: 240 * 1000 }]
   1. Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {
      let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed();
      assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
      });
6. The steps in steps file have a page object [page object is used like new HomePage(this.page)]
   1. Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {
      let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed();
      assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
      });
7. The steps in steps file have a method [method is used like isPayrollButtonDisplayed()]
   1. Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {
      let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed();
      assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
      });

   1. Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {
      let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed();
      assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');
      });
9. The steps in steps file have a description [description is used like 'Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page']
   1. Then('Run Payroll button is displayed on the Home Page', { timeout: 240 \* 1000 }, async function () {
      let runPayrollButtonDisplayed = await new HomePage(this.page).isPayrollButtonDisplayed();
      assert.isTrue(runPayrollButtonDisplayed, 'Run Payroll button is not displayed');

Our auto-coder-framework generated page file:
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/generated/pages/jira-story-classic-footer-page.js

## Observations and issues from our auto-coder-framework generated page file:

1.  The base structure is different from existing SBS_Automation framework page file
    Reference :
    const By = require('../../support/By');
    const helpers = require('../../support/helpers');
    let BasePage = require('../common/base-page');

        const BTN_ELEMENT = (btnName) => By.xpath(`//sdf-button[text() = "${btnName}"]`);
        const leftNavIcon = (leftNavName) => By.xpath(`//sdf-icon[@data-test-id='${leftNavName}-icon'] | //button[@data-test-id='${leftNavName}-btn']`);
        const SUBMISSION_BUTTON = (submissionButton) => By.xpath(`//sdf-button[contains(.,"${submissionButton}")]`);
        const SUBMISSION_MODAL_HEADER = (submissionModelHeader) => By.xpath(`//sdf-focus-pane[@heading="${submissionModelHeader}"]`);
        const SDF_MODAL_BUTTON = (buttonText) => By.css(`[aria-label*='${buttonText}']`);
        const MENUS_AVAILABLE = By.xpath('//div[@data-targetid=*]');

        class RunOnboardingPage extends BasePage {
        constructor(page) {
            super(page);
            this.page = page;
        }

1.  We do not have any of the above in our auto-coder-framework generated page file
    - We can add the above to our auto-coder-framework generated page file
    - We can use the same structure as existing SBS_Automation framework page file
1.  The class extends BasePage is missing in our auto-coder-framework generated page file
    - The class extends BasePage in existing SBS_Automation framework page file
    - We can add extends BasePage to our auto-coder-framework generated page file
    - Example: class ClassicFooterPage extends BasePage {
1.  The locators are declared on the top of the SBS_Automation framework page file
    Reference :
    const BTN_ELEMENT = (btnName) => By.xpath(`//sdf-button[text() = "${btnName}"]`);
    const leftNavIcon = (leftNavName) => By.xpath(`//sdf-icon[@data-test-id='${leftNavName}-icon'] | //button[@data-test-id='${leftNavName}-btn']`);
    const SUBMISSION_BUTTON = (submissionButton) => By.xpath(`//sdf-button[contains(.,"${submissionButton}")]`);
    const SUBMISSION_MODAL_HEADER = (submissionModelHeader) => By.xpath(`//sdf-focus-pane[@heading="${submissionModelHeader}"]`);
    const SDF_MODAL_BUTTON = (buttonText) => By.css(`[aria-label*='${buttonText}']`);
    const MENUS_AVAILABLE = By.xpath('//div[@data-targetid=*]');
    - The locators are not declared on the top of our auto-coder-framework generated page file
    - We can declare the locators on the top of our auto-coder-framework generated page file
    - Example: const BTN_ELEMENT = (btnName) => By.xpath(`//sdf-button[text() = "${btnName}"]`);

1.  The constructor is defined in the existing SBS_Automation framework page file
    Reference :
    class RunOnboardingPage extends BasePage {
    constructor(page) {
    super(page);
    this.page = page;
    }
    - The constructor is not defined in our auto-coder-framework generated page file
    - We can define the constructor in our auto-coder-framework generated page file
    - Example: constructor(page) { super(page); this.page = page; }

- The constructor should call the super(page) method to initialize the BasePage
- The constructor should assign the page object to this.page

4. Class Name: The class name in our auto-coder-framework generated page file is ClassicFooterPage [ extends BasePage is missing]
   - The class name in existing SBS_Automation framework page file is RunOnboardingPage extends BasePage
5. console.log statements: The console.log statements in our auto-coder-framework generated page file are used
   - The console.log statements in existing SBS_Automation framework page file are NOT present
   - We can remove console.log statements from our auto-coder-framework generated page file

We need to match 100% with the SBS_Automation framework.
Our auto-coder-framework generated page file should be same as existing SBS_Automation framework page file.

We have to implement the above observations and issues in our auto-coder-framework

Can we please implement these.
Please udpate with the both the prompts to refelect the same and we implement that.

run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

please update. And so when I request you know what's expected to be.

=============

Can we please avoid this?
When I ask you chat with the agent promt, can you please just continue and finish without any prompts for please.
Also, there are issus in the terminal with cmdand dquote> and I had to control +c all the times to terminate it.
Please fix both the above. Np prompting. No terminal issues.
Please see that ... When I request you with the agent prompt, please do all the steps without the additional prompts for me.

==========

For generating test artifacts:
cd /Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework
./auto-coder.sh run input/jira/jira-story-cfc-bundle.txt

For running tests
cd /Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework
./auto-coder.sh test generated/tests/jira-story-cfc-bundle-test.js

   - The tests should be able to run against the real application
   - The tests should not rely on any mocked data or responses

4. If possbile, let's a more detailed custom reports to make it easier to understand the test results
   - The reports should include the test steps, assertions, and any errors or failures
   - The reports should be easy to read and understand
   - The reports should be able to be generated in a format that can be easily shared with others
   - The reports should include screenshots or videos of the test execution
   - The report should explain in detail what the test is doing, what the expected behavior is, and what the actual errors are, including which locators are failing and what is expected from users to fix it.

Our auto-coder-framework generated page file should be same as existing SBS_Automation framework page file.

We have to implement the above observations and issues in our auto-coder-framework

Can we please implement these.
Please udpate with the both the prompts to refelect the same and we implement that.

run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

please update. And so when I request you know what's expected to be.

==============
Can we please add some ground rules for the auto-coder-framework to follow when generating test artifacts, running tests, and generating reports?

Here are some ground rules for the auto-coder-framework:

1. DOUBLE CHECK and DOUBLE VALIDATE all generated code and test artifacts with the following points
2. During the generation of test artifacts, ensure that all generated files are consistent with the existing SBS_Automation framework.
3. During the generation of test artifacts, ensure that all generated files follow the naming conventions and generation patterns used in the SBS_Automation framework.
4. During the generation of test artifacts, ensure that all generated files are functional a nd properly structured and no corrections are needed.
5. During the generation of test artifacts, ensure that all generated files are free of syntax errors and coding issues.
6. Follow the SBS_Automation pattern strictly when generating test artifacts.
7. Remove any console.log statements from generated code.
8. Include detailed summary, comments and documentation of the generated test artifacts, and how to edit, what to edit, where to edit, and how to run the tests when the real UI/application is available in the generated/summary with .md file using the same requirement file name and following by \_guide.md as part of the test artifacts.
9. Use real locators and selectors instead of mock implementations.
10. Ensure all tests are written in a way that they can run against the real application.
11. Validate all the generated test artifacts to make sure they are functional and follow best practices and patterns and obey the existing SBS_Automation framework.
12. Validate all page objects, steps, and feature files against the existing SBS_Automation framework.
13. Ensure that all tests are designed to fail if the locators are not valid, indicating that users need to update them.
14. Double check to make sure the generated test artifacts, such as feature file, steps file, and page object files, are consistent with the existing SBS_Automation framework and do not have any syntax errors or any coding issues.
15. Generate comprehensive reports that include test steps, assertions, and error details.
16. DOUBLE CHECK and DOUBLE VALIDATE all generated code and test artifacts with the above points
17. When running the tests, we need to ensure that the tests are not mocked and are using real locators

- The tests should fail if the locators are not valid
- The tests should be able to run against the real application [ofcourse they will fail because the locators are not valid]
- The tests should not rely on any mocked data or responses
- The tests should be able to run against the real application and validate the actual UI elements

19. The tests should be able to run against the real application and please use existing framework SBS_Automation for open application and login into.
20. Tests should generate detailed custom report to make it easier to understand the test results

- The reports should include the test steps, assertions, and any errors or failures
- The reports should be easy to read and understand
- The reports should be able to be generated in a format that can be easily shared with others
- The reports should include screenshots or videos of the test execution
- The report should explain in detail what the test is doing, what the expected behavior is, and what the actual errors are, including which locators are failing and what is expected from users to fix it.

21. We need to match 100% with the SBS_Automation framework.
22. DOUBLE CHECK and DOUBLE VALIDATE all generated code and test artifacts with the above points.

Can we please implement these.
Please update with the both the prompts to reflect the same and we implement that.
generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md
run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

please update the agent prompts. And so when I request you know what's expected to be.

==============

In the agent prompts [specfied below],
can you please add the following points to the generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md and run-test-artifacts.prompt.md files?
to generate test artifacts for the following input sources:
text files [txt, md]

## Project Clean Up and Finalization

I am going TRY on real application with the auto-coder-framework and I need few things to clean up and finalize before I can start using it

Please clean up the auto-coder-framework and finalize it with the following changes:

1. Please make sure any unused files, folders, and code are removed from the auto-coder-framework
2. Please make sure the auto-coder-framework is clean and ready to use
3. Please make sure the auto-coder-framework is functional and ready to use
4. The testing files such as ...-test files or test-... files [example : comprehensive-test.js, test-fixed-generator.js] should be removed from the auto-coder-framework
   - These files are not needed for the auto-coder-framework
   - These files are not used in the auto-coder-framework
   - These files are not needed for the auto-coder-framework to function properly
5. The .md files [other than readme.md and important project specific] should be removed from the auto-coder-framework

6. Any other files and folders that are not needed for the auto-coder-framework should be removed
7. Please make sure the auto-coder-framework is ready to use with the latest features and functionalities

## Test to make sure the auto-coder-framework is clean and ready to use

Please run the real generation tests for auto-coder-framework to make sure the auto-coder-framework is clean , fully functional, 100% matching with SBS_Automation and ready to use:

## Once all of the clean up is done...

Please document clearly, with full details, with screens, with code, with code snippets, with flow charts, with diagrams, what auto-coder-framework is, why auto-coder-framework is, how to use the auto-coder-framework, how to generate test artifacts, how to run tests, and how to generate reports and how to use the auto-coder-framework with real applications and real locators and save it as "All-About-Auto-Coder-Framework.md" in the root folder of the auto-coder-framework.
And please add any of the imprtant details that are needed to use the auto-coder-framework in the "All-About-Auto-Coder-Framework.md" file.
If I missed anything, please add it to the "All-About-Auto-Coder-Framework.md" file.

## Please update the README.md file with the following details:

- How to generate test artifacts
- How to run tests
- How to generate reports
- How to use the auto-coder-framework
- How to use the auto-coder-framework with real applications
- How to use the auto-coder-framework with real applications and real locators


========

# 1: --
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/playwright.config.js
playwright.config.js is complaining the missing file.
globalSetup: require.resolve('./generated/support/global-setup.js'),

#2: --
Seems like there are situations where we are missing feature steps implementation into steps file.
This might cause bigger problem later on as steps will fail and cause reaming / entire test to fail.
We should address this at root level.
Also, we should add a RULE to our agent prompts - NOT TO MISS any feature step implementation to steps file.

#3:-- 
Unable to run the generated tests. Please refer attached screen.
   "auto-coder-run": "./auto-coder.sh test generated/tests/jira-story-cfc-bundle-test.js",


#4:--
Please update the RULE [NOT TO MISS any feature step implementation to steps file] in agent prompts and so, we dont miss this kind of issues next time.

Agent Prompts files:
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

========
Ran the following script.
"auto-coder-run": "./auto-coder.sh test generated/tests/jira-story-rs-end-point-test.js",

## Here are the good things and improvements we can make to the auto-coder:
It executed the test - that's a very good sign.
All the Tests failed - that's expected as the locators are not valid.
We can make couple of things to improve the situation in auto-coder
1. Tests are running in various browsers - that's a good sign - But we dont need that.
   - Becasause we are not using the real locators and so, we dont need to run the tests in various browsers.
   - We can run the tests in one browser only, like chromium / chrome.
   - We can update the playwright.config.js file to run the tests in one browser only.
   - We can update the auto-coder.sh script to run the tests in one browser only
2. The test reports are generated after the execution - that's a good sign.
   1. But after that I did not see any reports generated/saved in auto-coder
   2. We need to save the reports in a specific folder, like generated/reports
   3. We can update the auto-coder.sh script to save the reports in a specific folder
   4. We can update the playwright.config.js file to save the reports in a specific folder
3. The test reports are not detailed enough - that's a bad sign.
   1. We need to generate custom reports that are easy to read and understand
   2. Our auto-coder should generate detailed custom reports with test steps, assertions, and error details and explaining what the test is doing, what the expected behavior is, and what the actual errors are, including which locators are failing and what is expected from users to fix it.
   2. We can update the auto-coder.sh script to generate detailed reports
   3. We can update the playwright.config.js file to generate detailed reports
   4. We can update the test artifacts to include detailed reports
   5. We need to generate detailed reports with test steps, assertions, and error details
   6. We can update the README.md file to include instructions on how to generate detailed reports
   7. We can update the All-About-Auto-Coder-Framework.md file to include instructions on how to generate detailed reports
4. Instead of Serving HTML report at http://localhost:9323. Press Ctrl+C to quit.
   1. We can load the HTML report in the browser directly
   2. We can save the HTML report in a specific folder, like generated/reports
   3. We can update the auto-coder.sh script to save the HTML report in a specific folder
   4. We can update the playwright.config.js file to save the HTML report in a specific folder
   5. We can update the README.md file to include instructions on how to save the HTML report
   6. We can update the All-About-Auto-Coder-Framework.md file to include instructions on how to save the HTML report
5. A custom report with more details, what failed, why failed, where failed, what locators are failing, what is expected from users to fix it, etc.
6. When we run the tests, we need to use settings,  configurations / test data file [ please refer SBS_Automation ] and open a browser and navigate to the application URL and login into the application.
   - We can update the auto-coder.sh script to use settings, configurations / test data file
   - We can update the playwright.config.js file to use settings, configurations / test data file
   - We can update the README.md file to include instructions on how to use settings, configurations / test data file
   - We can update the All-About-Auto-Coder-Framework.md file to include instructions on how to use settings, configurations / test data file
7. For the above step [6], we can use the existing SBS_Automation framework to open the application and login into the application.
   - We can update the auto-coder.sh script to use the existing SBS_Automation framework to open the application and login into the application
   - We can update the playwright.config.js file to use the existing SBS_Automation framework to open the application and login into the application and then play / run our auto-coder tests.
   - That way, we can use the existing SBS_Automation framework to open the application and login into the application
   - And this gives us the flexibility to run our auto-coder tests against the real application
   - We can update the README.md file to include instructions on how to use the existing SBS_Automation framework to open the application and login into the application
   - We can update the All-About-Auto-Coder-Framework.md file to include instructions on how to use the existing SBS_Automation framework to open the application and login into the application
 
 Can we please implement these.
Please update with the both the prompts to reflect the same and we implement that.
generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md
run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/generate-test-artifacts.prompt.md
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder-framework/.github/run-test-artifacts.prompt.md

please update the agent prompts. And so when I request you know what's expected to be.

==================

## NOTES:
# 1: 
When the tests execution is done , we need to open the generated custom detailed report.
file:///Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/generated/reports/custom/detailed-test-report.html

# 2:
We should also point users to use/view the general report generated by playwright
file:///Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/generated/reports/playwright-report/index.html

# 3:
The generated custom detailed report is not really detailed, it is not showing the test steps, assertions, and error details, locators, the expected behavior, and the actual errors.
We need to improve the custom detailed report generation logic in the auto-coder.
We need to generate the custom detailed report with test steps, assertions, and error details.

How do i specifcy my enviroment and app URL and login data for browser to open and login?
Where can I do that?
What file?
how do set environment
how do set app URL
how do set login data

So that we run our tests by opening on the sepfied environment, opening app URL and logging in and then running the actual auto-coder tests.

We might need to fix the hooks or index.js or some initial setup
Please address these in the auto-coder framework

==========

Here are needed Feature, steps, page, locators, and methods to implement the login functionality for MAX with digitalplus test credentials.

We can use these to implement the login functionality in our auto-coder framework.
We can use : /Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/support and create a new file called max-login.js and implement the login functionality there.

## Login to MAX with digitalplus test credentials : Feature step
Given RunOnboarding client is logged into MAX with digitalplus test credentials

## Steps to implement the above step
Given('RunOnboarding client is logged into MAX with digitalplus test credentials', { timeout: 180 * 1000 }, async function (login_user, login_password) {
   await new LoginPage(this.page).navigateTo(this.data.config.url);
  await new LoginPage(this.page).performMAXLogin(login_user, login_password);
});

# Method for login
 await new LoginPage(this.page).performMAXLogin(login_user, login_password);


## LoginPage and locators
let LoginPage = require('../../pages/common/practitioner-login');

const USERNAME = By.css('#login-form_username');
const PASSWORD = By.css('#login-form_password');
const VERIFY_USERID_BUTTON = By.css('#verifUseridBtn, #btnNext');
const REMIND_ME_LATER_BUTTON = By.xpath("//*[text() = 'Remind me later']");
const SIGN_IN_BUTTON = By.css('#signBtn, #btnNext');

We can use these to implement the login functionality in our auto-coder framework.
We can use : /Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/support and create a new file called max-login.js and implement the login functionality there.

The above implementation will help us to login to application
And then we can run our auto-coder tests against the application.


==============
Please refer the attached executed test report and log
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/generated/reports/custom/detailed-test-report.html
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/playwright-report/index.html

The following login functionality should be done before running any of the auto-coder tests.
But I see issues with it, I dont see the login into application is working.
It just loads the page and does not login into the application.
And each time a different URL loads.

Seems like somewhere the settings, configurations, environment, test data, URL and so on are not set properly.
We need to fix the login functionality in our auto-coder framework.
We need to implement the login functionality in our auto-coder framework so that we can login to the application before running any of the tests.


We have the following files in our auto-coder framework that are related to login functionality:
So that we can use these files to implement the login functionality in our auto-coder framework.
And then we can run our auto-coder tests against the application.

/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/support/features/max-login.feature
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/support/pages/max-login-page.js
/Users/arog/framework/auto-coder/support/steps/max-login-steps.js


But we are unable to login to the application using these files.
Did we miss anything?
Why are we unable to login?
Can we please check and fix the login functionality in our auto-coder framework?
And then we can run our auto-coder tests against the application.

Please check if we are missing any configuration, settings, environment, test data, URL and so on.
Please fix the login functionality in our auto-coder framework and  so we can use this prior to run any of the tests for test artifacts that we generatie and run the tests against the application.

Also, please make sure that the login functionality is implemented in a way that it can be reused before running our tests and scenarios for the test artifacts that we generate.
