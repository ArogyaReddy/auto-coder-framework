# JIRA Story: RS End Point - Employee Type Management

## üìã Requirement Analysis

### **Story Overview**
This story implements functionality for handling employee creation when employee type is unknown, and provides the ability to switch between W2 employee and contractor types after creation.

### **Key Features**
1. **Typeless Employee Creation**: Use new `runservices_employee` endpoint for employees without defined type
2. **Service Modification**: Update `service_doc_extraction` to handle unknown types (Driver's License scenarios)
3. **Employee Type Switching**: Allow conversion between W2 employee and contractor types in EE app
4. **Feature Flag Integration**: Implement with proper feature flag controls

### **Technical Components**

#### **Endpoints**
- `runservices_employee` - New endpoint for typeless employee creation
- `rs_employee` - Existing endpoint for standard employee/contractor creation

#### **Services**
- `service_doc_extraction` - Modified to handle unknown employee types
- `service_onboarding` - Enhanced with new feature flags

#### **Feature Flags**
- `enableWorkerCreationWithoutType` (service_onboarding)
- `enableDateValidationsForEmployeePayload` (service_onboarding)  
- `enableWorkerCreationForGenStruct` (service_doc_extraction)

### **Data Schema Mapping**
- Map extraction data to `runservices_employee` schema (different from standard endpoints)
- Handle Driver's License data without employee type determination
- Support schema transformations for typeless scenarios

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Typeless Employee Creation**
**Given** employee data is extracted from Driver's License
**When** employee type cannot be determined
**Then** system uses `runservices_employee` endpoint
**And** logs indicate typeless creation

### **Scenario 2: W2 to Contractor Conversion (Primary)**
**Given** W2 employee created from extraction
**When** user accesses EE app
**Then** user can switch employee to contractor type

### **Scenario 3: Contractor to W2 Conversion (Secondary)**
**Given** contractor created from extraction
**When** user accesses EE app
**Then** user can switch contractor to W2 employee type

### **Scenario 4: Feature Flag Controls**
**Given** feature flags are enabled
**When** processing employee extractions
**Then** new functionality is activated

### **Scenario 5: Schema Validation**
**Given** typeless employee data
**When** mapping to `runservices_employee`
**Then** data conforms to endpoint schema requirements

## üéØ Test Cases

### **Positive Test Cases**
1. Successfully create typeless employee from Driver's License
2. Log typeless employee creation events
3. Switch W2 employee to contractor in EE app
4. Switch contractor to W2 employee in EE app
5. Validate schema mapping for new endpoint
6. Verify feature flag behavior when enabled

### **Negative Test Cases**
1. Handle invalid data for `runservices_employee` endpoint
2. Manage conversion failures during type switching
3. Verify behavior when feature flags are disabled
4. Handle missing or incomplete extraction data

### **Edge Cases**
1. Multiple type switching operations
2. Concurrent user operations on same employee
3. System behavior during endpoint unavailability
4. Data consistency during type conversions

## üîß Implementation Details

### **Database Changes**
- Employee type field modifications
- Audit trail for type changes
- Support for typeless employee states

### **API Integration**
- New `runservices_employee` endpoint integration
- Schema mapping implementation
- Error handling for endpoint failures

### **User Interface**
- Employee type switching controls in EE app
- Type conversion confirmation dialogs
- Status indicators for typeless employees

## üìä Acceptance Criteria Validation

### **AC1: Primary Use Case**
- ‚úÖ W2 employee created from extraction
- ‚úÖ Visible in EE app
- ‚úÖ Switchable to contractor type

### **AC2: Secondary Use Case**
- ‚úÖ Contractor created from extraction
- ‚úÖ Visible in EE app  
- ‚úÖ Switchable to W2 employee type

## üö® Risk Assessment

### **High Risk Areas**
- Data integrity during type conversions
- Schema mapping accuracy
- Feature flag dependency management

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Data validation checkpoints
- Rollback mechanisms for conversions

## üìù Testing Strategy

### **Unit Testing**
- Schema mapping functions
- Feature flag logic
- Type conversion utilities

### **Integration Testing**
- End-to-end employee creation flow
- Type switching workflows
- Cross-service communication

### **User Acceptance Testing**
- EE app functionality
- User experience validation
- Performance testing under load
