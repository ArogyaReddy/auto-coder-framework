The logic to set the prior payroll provider in service_onboarding was modified so that it will incorrectly set the prior payroll provider. There are two scenarios that need to be adjusted.

src/server/lib/aboutYourCompany/mapSalesOrderToAboutYourCompanyDetails.js - line 44 ish

If the priorMethodDetail is not set (undefined, null, '') then priorPayrollProvider should not be set (it is currently set to Other which is wrong)
If the priorMethodDetail is 48 (New Company - No Existing Vendor) then set priorPayrollProvider to nothing as they don't have one. This is a new situation that I am seeing clients coming in as this and they shouldn't be marked as Other.
Each environment has a different ID for this. Currently Paychex, QB, and Gusto are handled through consul for this. The same thing is needed to support this one to account for the different IDs.
FIT - 35
IAT - 39
Prod - 48
