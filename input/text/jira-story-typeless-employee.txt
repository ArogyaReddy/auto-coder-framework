Add an endpoint on runservices_employee to accept the worker hire schema and internally call the TAP endpoint to create the type less employee. API will be provided (Will should know). 

Look at the TAP API to see about the email sending to the employee and requiring the email address. Clover doesn't do either so we need to make that configurable hopefully by passing data in to the API.

Acceptance criteria:

The rs_employee endpoint is available and creates a type less employee.
 

If we have created an employee as a W2 employee there is a chance that actually they should have been set up as a contractor. Example being where employee is created from a driver's License as it doesn't tell us the employee type. We need to provide Alex with the ability to change the employee to be a contractor. 

I think changing the other way ie Contractor to Employee is less likely. Today we create contractors form documents that are obviously for contractors only (ie W-9 or DLs where client has the 1099 bundle) so its less likely that we create a contractor in error. If its easier to support changing either way then lets do that else EE to contractor is the prime scenario. 


AC1: Prime use case.
Given I have an W2 employee created from an extraction
When I see them in the EE app
Then I should be able to switch them to be a contractor 

AC2:  Secondary use case.
Given I have an contractor created from an extraction
When I see them in the EE app
Then I should be able to switch them to be a W2 employee
