User Login Feature Test

As a user of the auto-coder-framework validation
I want to test the login functionality
So that I can ensure the framework generates proper test artifacts

Acceptance Criteria:
- User can enter username and password
- System validates the credentials
- User is redirected to dashboard on successful login
- Error message is displayed for invalid credentials

Test Scenarios:
1. Valid Login
   Given user is on the login page
   When user enters valid username "testuser" and password "testpass"
   And user clicks the login button
   Then user should be redirected to the dashboard
   And welcome message should be displayed

2. Invalid Login
   Given user is on the login page
   When user enters invalid username "baduser" and password "badpass"
   And user clicks the login button
   Then error message "Invalid credentials" should be displayed
   And user should remain on the login page

3. Empty Credentials
   Given user is on the login page
   When user clicks the login button without entering credentials
   Then validation messages should be displayed
   And login button should remain disabled
